A Rust rewrite of the PPPwn exploit - PlayStation 4 PPPoE RCE by theflow [here](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn)  

Hereâ€™s an article about the exploit/Rust rewrite written by me. TODO: ADD ARTICLE.
This project was created for fun and to learn Rust, so feel free to contribute!

## FAQ
### Why?
I wanted to learn Rust and was curious about the inner workings of the exploit by theFlow.

### Why did you use X instead of Y?  
I'm still learning. If Y is better than X, please feel free to open a pull request and explain!
